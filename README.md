# DSI Studio data hub for brain diseases

Brain diseases, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders, are a major public health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding the underlying neural mechanisms and developing effective treatments for these conditions require access to large-scale, high-quality neuroimaging data. However, collecting and processing such data can be a significant challenge, particularly for researchers who lack the resources and expertise to manage and analyze large datasets.
To address this need, we have established the DSI Studio Data Hub, a cloud-based repository of preprocessed and reconstructed fiber tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans of patients with various brain diseases. The Data Hub is a comprehensive resource that provides researchers with easy access to a large collection of high-quality, ready-to-trace fiber tracts, enabling them to explore and analyze the complex neural networks affected by brain disease. With over 20,000 preprocessed and reconstructed fiber tracts from patients with a range of brain diseases, the DSI Studio Data Hub is an unparalleled resource for researchers seeking to advance our understanding of brain disease and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

By providing a centralized platform for data sharing and analysis, the DSI Studio Data Hub aims to facilitate collaboration and accelerate discovery in brain disease research. Researchers can use the Data Hub to explore and analyze large-scale datasets, identify patterns and trends, and develop new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying brain disease. The Data Hub also provides a framework for integrating multimodal data, enabling researchers to combine dMRI data with other neuroimaging modalities, such as functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of brain function and dysfunction.
